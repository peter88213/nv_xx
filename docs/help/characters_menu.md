# ${Characters} menu

**Character operation**

## ${Add}

**Add a new character**

With **${Characters} > ${Add}** you can add a character to the tree.

-   If a character is selected, the new character is placed after the
    selected one.
-   Otherwise, the new character is placed at the last position.
-   The new character has an auto-generated title. You can change it in
    the right pane.
-   The status of newly created characters is *minor*.

## ${Set Status}

**Set the character status**

With **${Characters} > ${Set Status}**, you can make the selected character
*major* or *minor*. Major characters are highlighted in the tree view.

> **Note**
> 
> The character status is only for visual distinction. It has no influence
> on the program functions. Nevertheless, you can use it to mark viewpoint
> characters or characters with their own arcs.

## ${Import}

**Import characters from another project**

With **${Characters} > ${Import}**, you can import a selection of characters
from another project. First you select an XML file containing the
character data. Then you select the characters you want to add to the
current project.

> **Hint**
> 
> To create an XML character data file for the current project, use
> **${Export} > ${XML data files}**.

## ${Export character descriptions for editing}

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Characters} > ${Export character descriptions for editing}**, you
can create a text document that contains character descriptions, bio,
goals, and notes that can be edited in Office Writer and reimported.
File name suffix is `_characters_tmp`.

## ${Export character table}

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Characters} > ${Export character table}**, you can create a
spreadsheet that contains a row per character. The document can be
edited with *Calc* and reimported. File name suffix is `_charlist_tmp`.

> **Note**
> 
> You can reorder, hide or delete columns and rows without affecting the
> reimport. Only the first column and the first row, which are hidden by
> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.

## ${Show table in Browser}

**Show an HTML report with characters data**

With **${Characters} > ${Show table in Browser}**, you can create a HTML file
that contains a character table, and launch your system's web browser
for displaying it.

> **Note**
> 
> The report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit. If needed,
> you can have your web browser save or print it.
