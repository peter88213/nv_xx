**User guide**

This page refers to the latest

The plugin adds a **Check for updates** entry to the *novelibre*
**Tools** menu, and an **Update checker Online help** entry to the

## Start the update checker

Open the update checker from the main menu: **Tools \> Check for

    The *nv_updater* plugin only initiates the download process via the
    system web browser. If a download directory is preset, the
    installation files with the downloaded releases will end up there.
    You then perform the actual installation manually as usual.
