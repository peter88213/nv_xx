# nv_tlview

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_tlview](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_tlview/) release. You can
open it with **Help > Timeline view Online help** or with `F1`.

*nv_tlview* is a plugin providing a timeline view with sections that are
given a narrative date/day and time.

The plugin adds a **Timeline view** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools**
menu, and a **Timeline view Online help** entry to the **Help** menu.
The Toolbar gets a ![Timeline](images/tlview.png) button.

## Operation

### Start the Timeline view

-   Open the Timeline view either from the main menu: **Tools >
    Timeline view**,
-   or via the ![Timeline](images/tlview.png) button in the toolbar.

### Mouse scrolling

-   Scroll the timeline horizontally with `${Shift}`-`Mousewheel`.
-   Scroll the timeline vertically with the mousewheel.
-   Scroll the timeline in any direction by right-clicking on the canvas
    and dragging the mouse.
-   Increase or reduce the time scale with `${Ctrl}`-`Mousewheel`.
-   Change the distance limits for stacking with
    `${Shift}`-`${Ctrl}`-`Mousewheel`.

### Selecting a section in the *novelibre* project tree

-   Select a section by double klicking on a timeline marker. This will
    bring the *novelibre* application window in the foreground.

### Shifting a section in time

-   Hold down the `${Shift}` button and click on the timeline marker, then
    drag it with the mouse. This will move the section forward or
    backward in time while keeping the duration.

### Shifting the section end

-   Hold down the `${Ctrl}` and `${Shift}` buttons and click on the timeline
    marker, then drag it with the mouse. This will increase or decrease
    the section's duration while keeping the start date/time.



Hint
:::

\- Shifting operations with the mouse can be aborted with the `Esc` key
before releasing the mouse button. - Shifting operations with the mouse
can be undone with ![undo](images/undo.png).

## Command reference

### "Go to" menu

First section

:   Shift the timeline so that the earliest section is positioned near
    the left edge of the window.

Last section

:   Shift the timeline so that the latest section is positioned near the
    right edge of the window.

Selected section

:   Shift the timeline so that the section selected in the *novelibre*
    project tree is positioned in the center of the window.

### "Scale" menu

Hours

:   This sets the scale to one hour per line.

Days

:   This sets the scale to one day per line.

Years

:   This sets the scale to one year per line.

Fit to window

:   This sets the scale and moves the timeline, so that all sections
    with valid or substituted date/time information fit into the window.

### "Cascading" menu

The section marks are stacked on the timeline canvas, so that they would
not overlap or cover the title of previous sections. If the stacking
algorithm does not seem good enough to you, you can adjust its limits.

Tight

:   Arrange consecutive sections behind each other, even if they are
    close together.

Relaxed

:   Arrange consecutive sections in a stack, even if they are some
    distance apart.

Standard

:   Reset the cascading to default.



Hint
:::

You can fine-tune the stacking limits with `${Shift}`-`${Ctrl}`-`Mousewheel`.

### "Options" menu

Use 00:00 for missing times

:   -   If ticked, "00:00" is used as display time for sections
        without time information. This does not affect the section
        properties.
    -   If unticked, sections without time information are not
        displayed.

Online help

:   Open this help page in a web browser.
