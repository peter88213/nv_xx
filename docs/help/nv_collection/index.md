# nv_collection

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_collection](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_collection/) release.
You can open it with **Help > Collection plugin Online help**.

If you have several *novelibre* projects, you can manage them as books
in a collection, also organized by series. A collection gives you quick
access to your projects.

## Start the collection manager

Open the collection manager from the main menu: **File > Collection**.

## Open a collection

By default, the latest collection selected is preset. You can change it
with **File > Open**.

## Create a new collection

With **File > New**, you can create a new collection. This will close
the current collection and open a file dialog asking for the location
and file name of the collection to create. Once you specified a valid
file path, a blank collection appears.

## Create a new series

With **Series > Add**, you can add a new series. Edit the series' title
and description in the right window.

## Add books to the collection

To add the current novelibre project as a book to the collection, use
**Book > Add current project to the collection**. If a series is
selected, the book is added as a part of this series.

## Update book description

To update the book description from the current project, use **Book >
Update book data from the current project**.



Caution
:::

Be sure not to change the book title, because it is used as identifier.
:::

To update the current project description from the book, use **Book >
Update project data from the selected project**.

## Remove books from the collection

To remove the selected book from the collection, use **Book > Remove
selected book from the collection**.

## Move series and books

Drag and drop while pressing the `Alt` key.



Caution
:::

Be aware, there is no "Undo" feature.
:::

## Remove books

To remove a book from the collection, either select the book and hit the
`Del` key, or use **Book > Remove selected book from the collection**.



Note
:::

When removing a book from the collection, the project file associated is
kept on disc.
:::

## Delete a series

To delete a series, either select the series and hit the `Del` key, or
use **Series > Remove selected series but keep the books**.



Note
:::

When deleting a series, the books are kept by default.
:::

To delete the selected series and remove all its books from the
collection, use **Series > Remove selected series**.

## Quit/Exit

-   Under Windows you can exit with **File > Exit** or `Alt`-`F4`.
-   Otherwise you can exit with **File > Quit** or `${Ctrl}`-`Q`.
