# The Workspace

## Overview

The *novelibre* workspace is divided into three panes:

![Workspace](images/workspace01.png)

## Project tree

The project tree in the left pane shows the organization of the project.

-   The tree elements are color-coded according to the section type.
    *${Normal}* type sections are highlighted according to the selected
    coloring mode (see *${Options}* in the ${View} menu).
-   The order of the columns can be changed (see *${Options}* in the ${View} menu).
-   Right-clicking on a tree element opens a context menu with several options.
-   The type of chapters and sections, as well as the completion status
    of the sections are color coded and can be changed via context menu.

### Project tree structure

-   The **${Book}** branch contains the parts, chapters, and sections that
    belong to the novel manuscript.
-   The **${Characters}/${Locations}/${Items}** branches contain descriptions of
    the story world's elements that can be associated with the book's sections.
-   The **${Plot lines}** branch contains the plot lines and plot points.
-   The **${Project notes}** branch contains project notes.

### Project tree operation

#### Browsing the tree

*novelibre* has a browsing history for the selected tree elements.
This allows you to go back and forth e.g. between a section and its related characters.

-   ![Go back](images/goBack.png) or `Alt`-`Left`: Go forward in
    history.
-   ![Go forward](images/goForward.png) or `Alt`-`Right`: Go back
    in history.

> **Hint**
> 
> On Windows, the "Forward" and "Back" mouse buttons (if any) may also work.

#### Skipping other kinds of nodes

With the `Alt` key hold down, you can navigate directly to the next
or previous tree element on the same level (e.g. section or chapter
or character).

-   `Alt`-`Up`: Go to the previous node of the same kind.
-   `Alt`-`Down`: Go to the next node of the same kind.

#### Move tree elements

Drag and drop while holding down the `Alt` key.

> **Hint**
> 
> With some Linux desktops, it may be necessary to first press the mouse
> button, then the `Alt` key.

> **Caution**
> 
> Be aware, there is no "Undo" feature.

#### Delete tree elements

Select the element to delete and hit the `Del` key.

-   Parts and chapters are deleted.
-   Sections are marked "${Unused}" and moved to the "Trash" chapter.
-   Deleting a part has no effect on its subordinate chapters.
-   Deleting a chapter moves its sections to the "Trash" chapter.
-   The "Trash" chapter is created automatically, if needed.
-   When deleting the "Trash" chapter, all its sections are deleted.

#### Copy/paste tree elements

You can copy and paste the following tree elements via the system clipboard:

-   Parts and chapters,
-   sections,
-   stages,
-   plot lines,
-   plot points,
-   characters,
-   locations,
-   items,
-   project notes.

Elements can be transferred to and from the clipboard one by one. The
element's properties and "children" are copied, except relationships.

Via the clipboard, you can transfer these elements between different
*novelibre* projects, or within a project.

## Text viewer

The **Text viewer** in the middle pane shows the part/chapter/section
contents with their titles as headings.

-   You can open or close the middle pane with the Text viewer with
    **${View} > ${Toggle Text viewer}**, or `${Ctrl}`-`T`, or clicking on
    ![Toggle Text viewer](images/viewer.png).
-   On opening, the text viewer shows the text where the tree is selected.
-   When changing the tree selection, the text moves along.
-   However, the text can be scrolled independently with the vertical
    scrollbar, or the mousewheel.
-   You can select text with the mouse, and copy it to the clipboard with `${Ctrl}`-`C`.
-   You cannot edit the text in the viewer. For this, you might want to
    install an editor plugin, such as
    [nv_editor](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_editor/).
-   Section text is color-coded according to the section type.
-   With the **${Show markup}** checkbox, XML markup can be shown/hidden.

## Properties

The Properties in the right pane show properties and
metadata of the element selected in the project tree.

-   The project settings can be made in the *Book* properties view.
-   You can open or close the element properties window with
    **${View} > ${Toggle Properties}** or `${Ctrl}`-`Alt`-`T`, or clicking on 
    ![Toggle Properties](images/properties.png).
-   On opening, the windows shows the editable properties of the selected element.
-   You can detach or dock the element properties window with 
    **${View} > ${Detach/Dock Properties}** or `${Ctrl}`-`Alt`-`D`.
-   On closing the detached window, the properties are docked again.

On large screens, you can arrange *novelibre* and *Writer* with detached windows.


## Menu bar

The bar at the top is the menu bar with the main menu, which is
documented in the Command reference.

## Toolbar

The second bar from the top is the toolbar with buttons for frequently used actions.

## Status bar

The second bar from the bottom is the status bar. It normally displays project 
statistics, such as word count. These are overwritten with program messages when necessary.

-   Messages on a green background indicate successful actions.
-   Messages on a yellow background indicate notifications or warnings.
-   Messages on a red background indicate errors.

> **Tip**
> 
> You can restore the normal view at any time by clicking on the status bar.


## Footer bar

The footer bar at the bottom displays the project file path and the file date.

### Change notification

If there are unsaved changes, the footer bar is highlighted in goldenrod.

### Project lock

If the project is locked, the footer bar is displayed in reversed colors.
