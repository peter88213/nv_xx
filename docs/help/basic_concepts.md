# Basic concepts

## Summary

-   With *novelibre* you can organize your novel on three hierarchical
    levels.
-   If you shorten your novel, you can exclude individual chapters and
    sections without deleting them immediately. You can also write
    sections with alternative text so that you can decide later what you
    want to include in the final version. To do this, change the *type*.
-   Part of organizing your writing project is keeping track of the
    qualitative progress of your work. With *novelibre* you can break
    this down to the section level using the *section completion status*
    and section notes.
-   *novelibre* offers a limited number of options for highlighting
    text.
-   Comments, footnotes and endnotes that you insert with *Writer* are
    not lost.
-   Language assignments for the spell checker in *Writer* are not lost.
-   So that you don't get confused, *novelibre* can lock the project
    against changes as long as you are working with OpenOffice or
    LibreOffice.

## The ${Book} hierarchy

### ${Parts}

A novel is expected to be divided into chapters and sections. Parts are
optional; technically they are first level chapters. However, in the
*novelibre* project tree they are on the same level as the chapters, but
they produce a heading one level above. Thus, parts are mainly for
inserting first level headings between the chapters, if needed.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can convert chapters into parts and vice versa by simply changing
> the level.


### ${Chapters}

A *novelibre* project must at least have one chapter. In the exported
documents, regular chapters have a second level heading.

For *novelibre*, the chapters only serve as containers for sections to
which the actual dramaturgical function is assigned. This is why there
are only a few chapter properties to be set.

#### ${Epigraph}

If you want to preface a chapter or part with a poem or a quotation, you
can set its first section to be the epigraph.

![novelibre screenshot](images/basic_concepts06.png)

The epigraph appears in the exported ODT document between the chapter
heading and the actual start of the chapter.

An epigraph differs from a regular section in that it is formatted using
the **${Epigraph}** paragraph style. If you add a description to the
epigraph, this will be placed below the epigraph as a source reference,
formatted using the **${Epigraph source}** paragraph style.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can temporarily exclude an epigraph from document export by changing
> its section type to *${Unused}* (see below).


### ${Sections}

All body text of a novel in *novelibre* belongs to sections. Sections
can be scenes, pieces of exposition, descriptions, narrative
summaries---it is entirely up to you how you divide your text into
sections. There is a variety of metadata for sections for your free use.

In the text body of the exported documents, sections are separated by
section dividers by default, like so:

`* * *`

However, if you need more fragmented sections when plotting and
organizing than the reader should see later, you can also append
sections to each other as new paragraphs with no section divider inbetween.

The image below illustrates both types of section transition. On the
left, you can see a normal transition with a section divider. On the
right, the fine horizontal line indicates that a new, appended section
is beginning.

## Part/chapter/section types

Each part, chapter, and section is of a type that can be changed via
context menu or Part/Chapter/Section menu. The type can be *${Normal}* or
*${Unused}*.

### ${Normal}

-   "${Normal}" type parts, chapters, and sections are counted. The
    totals are displayed in the status bar.
-   "${Normal}" type sections are exported to the manuscript and
    included in the word count.
-   "${Normal}" type parts and chapters can have subelements of each
    type.
-   "${Normal}" type tree elements are color coded according to the
    ${Coloring mode} settings.

### ${Unused}

You can mark parts, chapters, and sections as ${Unused} to exclude them
from word count totals and export.

-   The subelements of ${Unused} parts and chapters are ${Unused} as well.
-   If you mark a section "${Unused}", its properties are preserved.
-   ${Unused} tree elements are displayed in gray.

## Section completion status

You can assign a ${Status} to each "${Normal}" type section via context menu
or ${Section} menu. You can choose between *${Outline}*, *${Draft}*, *${1st Edit}*,
*${2nd Edit}*, and *${Done}*.

-   You can choose a ${Coloring mode} to display sections in different colors 
    depending on their completion status.

    ![novelibre screenshot](images/basic_concepts02.png)

-   Optionally, you can declare one of the status to be the current
    ${Work phase}, and choose a ${Coloring mode} that highlights sections 
    that are behind schedule.

    ![novelibre screenshot](images/basic_concepts03.png)

-   Newly created sections are set to ${Outline} by default.

-   Word counts by status appear in the ${Book} properties.

> **Hint**
> 
> The "sticky" section notes are intended for more detailed information on what 
> still needs to be done for a section.

## Characters and story world

You can define ${Characters}, ${Locations}, and ${Items}, and you can relate them
to sections to keep track of their place in the story. There is also
some metadata stored with *novelibre*, mainly as a quick reference that
might come in handy when writing or editing.

> **Note**
> 
> *novelibre* is not meant as a tool for extensive world building. For
> this, there is a plethora of dedicated applications, online and offline
> wikis, and notetaking software. However, *novelibre* offers the option
> of linking images and files with the characters, locations, and items to
> facilitate access if your external application allows this.
> 
> The [nv_zim plugin](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_zim/) connects the
> writing project with a **Zim Desktop Wiki**. This allows the elements of
> the narrative world to be linked to corresponding wiki pages.

> **Important**
> 
> If you want to assign **viewpoint characters** to your sections, you
> first have to create the characters that come into question.

## Formatting text

It is assumed that very few types of text markup are needed for a novel
text. When importing from ODT, *novelibre* supports the following
formats:

-   *Emphasized* style or italics.
-   *Strongly emphasized* style or bold.
-   *Quotations* (paragraph visually distinguished from body text).
-   *Unordered list item* (indented paragraph with a bullet).


> **Important**
> 
> *novelibre* does not support combinations of "hard" character
> formattings such as bold and italics. When *novelibre* imports an ODT
> text document containing such combinations, italics "wins" in the form
> of the *Emphasis* style.
> 
> To ensure that there are no surprises here, you should avoid using hard
> formatting when writing and instead use the character styles *Emphasis*
> and *Strong Emphasis*. The extension
> [emph](https://peter88213.github.io/emph/) can help with this.
> 
> If you want to combine the character styles *Emphasis* and *Strong
> Emphasis*, first assign the *Strong Emphasis* style to the text passage,
> and then make it italic.

## Comments, footnotes, endnotes

ODT comments, footnotes, and endnotes are supported by *novelibre*.


> **Tip**
> 
> *novelibre* has no support for images in the text body. You can instead
> use comments as placeholders. Replace them with your images (or any
> other special formatting beyond the capabilities of *novelibre*) at the
> end, when you prepare your finished novel for publishing.

## About document language handling

ODF documents are generally assigned a language that determines spell
checking and country-specific character substitutions. In addition,
Office Writer lets you assign text passages to languages other than the
document language to mark foreign language usage or to suspend spell
checking.

### Document overall

The project language (Language code acc. to ISO 639-1 and country
code acc. to ISO 3166-2) can be set in the **${Book}** settings 
(right pane) under ${Document language}.

### Text passages in sections

Paragraph-wise or inline text markup for other languages is
supported by *novelibre*.

## Project lock

When exporting a document that can be edited outsides *novelibre*, the
project can be automatically locked in order to prevent confusion. This
behavior depends on the ${Export} settings.

> **Important**
> 
> The project can only be locked if all changes are saved.

In locked state, the project cannot be modified via the user interface.
The footer bar is then displayed in reversed colors, the menu entries
for changing data, saving, importing, and exporting are greyed out, and
the widgets in the *Properties* view are disabled. With
![manuscript](images/manuscript.png) you can open an existing
manuscript, if newer than the project file.

The project lock is nothing more than a strong reminder. You can unlock
the project at any time. You also can manually lock the project, if necessary. 
The ![Lock/Unlock](images/lock.png) toolbar button toggles the locking state.

> **Hint**
> 
> The project lock state is persistent. This is achieved by automatically
> creating a lock file named `.LOCK.<project name>.novx#`. If you delete
> this file while *novelibre* is not running, the project will be unlocked
> upon next start.
