# nv_snapshots

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_snapshots](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_snapshots/) release. You
can open it with **${Help} > ${Snapshots Online help}** or `F1`.

The plugin adds a **Snapshots** entry to the *novelibre* **${Tools}** menu,
a **Snapshot** entry to the **File** menu, and a 
**Snapshots Online help** entry to the **${Help}** menu.

## General

A snapshot is a compressed, titled, and commented version of a *.novx*
file. *nv_snapshots* creates such snapshots on demand and stores them in
a subdirectory of the project folder. This subdirectory is named
*"Snapshots"* and is created automatically if required. Saving a
snapshot is manually triggered via `${Ctrl}`-`Alt`-`S` or the 
**${File} > ${Snapshot}** menu command.

Use the **${Tools} > ${Snapshots}** menu command to start the 
**snapshot manager**. The snapshot manager displays the snapshots of the currently
open project in list form. You can select individual snapshots and
export documents from them. LibreOffice/OpenOffice has a document
comparison function that allows you to find and edit the differences
between the snapshot and the current project. You can also easily revert
to any snapshot.

## How to compare the current state of your project with a snapshot

If you do not want to return to a previous state of your project, but
want to undo individual changes since a snapshot was created, you can do
this conveniently using the document comparison function of
LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

1.  Select the desired snapshot in the snapshot manager and export a
    document that you want to compare (e.g. the manuscript).
2.  Export a document of the same kind from the current project and open
    it.
3.  Select **Edit - Track Changes - Compare Document\...**
    (LibreOffice), or **${Edit} > ${Compare Document}** (OpenOffice).
4.  A file selection dialog opens. Select the "snapshot document" and
    click **Insert**.

LibreOffice/OpenOffice combines both documents into the current
document. All text passages that occur in the current project but not in
the snapshot are identified as having been inserted, and all text
passages that got deleted since the snapshot has been created are
identified as deletions.

You can now accept or reject the insertions and deletions. At the end
you may reimport the updated document in *novelibre* in order to
transfer the revised state to the project.
