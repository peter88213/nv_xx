# nv_editor

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_editor](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_editor/) release. You can
open it with **${Help} > ${Editor plugin Online help}**.

You can use the section editor to quickly edit and split individual
sections. The editor provides access to the internal markup, which is
similar to HTML.

## Launch the section editor

Open a section editor window by double-clicking on a section, or via the
**${Section} > ${Edit}** menu entry when a section is selected, or by hitting
the `Enter` key.


> **Note**
> 
> -   If the project is locked, editor windows cannot be opened.
> -   If you choose a section already open, the window will be brought to
>     the foreground.


## Select text

-   Select a word via double-clicking.
-   Select a paragraph via triple-clicking.
-   Extend the selection via `${Shift}`-`Arrow`.
-   Extend the selection to the next word via `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Arrow`.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`A` selects the whole text.

## Copy/Paste text

-   `${Ctrl}`-`C` copies the selected text to the clipboard.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`X` cuts the selected text and moves it to the clipboard.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`V` pastes the clipboard text content to the cursor position.

## Format text

-   `${Ctrl}`-`I` places "emphasized" markup around the selected text or
    at the cursor, like so:

    `<em>Example</em>`{.html}

    If the selection is already emphasized, the command removes the
    markup.

-   `${Ctrl}`-`B` places "strong" markup around the selected text or at
    the cursor, like so:

    `<strong>Example</strong>`{.html}

    If the selection is already strong, the command removes the markup.

-   `${Ctrl}`-`M` removes "emphasized" and "strong" markup from the
    selection.

## Undo/Redo

-   `${Ctrl}`-`Z` undoes the last editing. Multiple undo is possible.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`Y` redoes the last undo. Multiple redo is possible.

## Split a section

With **${File} > ${Split at cursor position}** or `${Ctrl}`-`Alt`-`S`, you can
split the section at the cursor position.

-   All the text from the cursor position is cut and pasted into a newly
    created section.
-   The new section is placed after the currently edited section.
-   The new section is appended to the currently edited section.
-   The new section has the same status as the currently edited section.
-   The new section is of the same type as the currently edited section.
-   The new section has the same viewpoint character as the currently
    edited section.
-   The editor loads the newly created section.

## Create a section

With **${File} > ${Create section}** or `${Ctrl}`-`Alt`-`N`, you can create a section.

-   The new section is placed after the currently edited section.
-   The new section is of the same type as the currently edited section.
-   The editor loads the newly created section.

## Word count

-   The section word count is displayed at the status bar at the bottom
    of the window.
-   By default, word count is updated manually, either by pressing the
    `F5` key, or via the **${Word count} > ${Update}** menu entry.
-   The word count can be updated "live", i.e. just while entering
    text. This is enabled or disabled via the 
    **${Word count} > ${Live update}** menu checkbox.


> **Note**
> 
> Live updating the word count is resource intensive and may slow down the
> program when editing big sections. This is why it's disabled by default.


## Apply changes

With `${Ctrl}`-`S`, you can apply changes to the section. Then "Modified"
status is displayed in *novelibre*.

-   If the project is locked in *novelibre*, you will be asked to unlock
    it before changes can be applied.


> **Note**
> 
> Before applying changes, the program checks the editor content for XML
> validity. Malformed XML will not be accepted.


## Close the editor window

-   To close the editor window, click on the **${Close}** button, or just close the window.
-   Under Windows you can optionally exit with **${Section} > ${Exit}** or `Alt`-`F4`.
-   Otherwise you can optionally exit with **${Section} > ${Quit}** or `${Ctrl}`-`Q`.
-   When closing the editor window, you will be asked for applying changes.
