# nv_templates

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_templates](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_templates/) release. You
can open it with **Help \> Templates plugin Online help**.

With *novelibre*, you can define a narrative structure with stages. See
[Plotting with novelibre](../plotting.html). *nv_templates* faciliates
the reuse of narrative structures.

The plugin adds a **Story Templates** entry to the *novelibre* **Tools**
menu, a **Create from Template\...** entry to the **File \> New**
submenu, and a **Template plugin Online Help** entry to the **Help**
menu.

The plugin comes with sample templates which are automatically copied
into the *templates* folder of the *novelibre* installation. Existing
files are overwritten. So if you customize your templates, better rename
them.

## Conventions

### Markdown file structure

The *Story Template* Markdown file defines a narrative structure with
the help of headings and ordinary text.

#### First level heading for top level stages, e.g. acts

The first level heading begins with `#`, followed by a space and a stage
title.

#### Second level heading for minor stages or turning points

The second level heading begins with `##`, followed by a space and a
stage title.

#### Ordinary text

Any text under a heading is used as notes for the element generated from
the heading.

#### Example

``` markdown
# ACT 1

Setup

## Inciting Incident

Also called "catalyst" or "call to adventure".
This sets the protagonist in motion.

## Plot Point 1

"Point of no return": The protagonist engages with the action 
the inciting incident has created.

# ACT 2

Confrontation

## Midpoint

The main turning point. A significant event, changing the 
development of things from good to bad, or vice versa.

## Plot Point 2

The aftermath of the Midpoint crisis.
What changes the protagonist from "passenger" to "driver".  

# ACT 3

Resolution

## Climax

The final moment of the story's conflict.
