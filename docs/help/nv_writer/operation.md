## Move the cursor and select text

-   Clicking the left mouse button positions the cursor just before the
    character underneath the mouse cursor, sets the input focus, and
    clears any selection.
-   Dragging with the left mouse button strokes out a selection between
    the cursor and the character under the mouse.
-   Double-clicking the left mouse button selects the word under the
    mouse and positions the cursor at the beginning of the word.
-   Dragging after a double click will stroke out a selection consisting
    of whole words.
-   Triple-clicking the left mouse button selects the line under the
    mouse and positions the cursor at the beginning of the line.
-   Dragging after a triple click will stroke out a selection consisting
    of whole lines.
-   The ends of the selection can be adjusted by dragging with the left
    mouse button while `${Shift}` is down; this will adjust the end of the
    selection that was nearest to the mouse cursor when the left button
    was pressed.
-   If the button is double-clicked before dragging then the selection
    will be adjusted in units of whole words; if it is triple-clicked
    then the selection will be adjusted in units of whole lines.
-   Clicking the left mouse button with `${Ctrl}` down will reposition the
    cursor without affecting the selection.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`A` and `${Ctrl}`-`/` select the whole text.
-   `Left` and `Right` move the cursor one character to the left or
    right and clear any selection in the text.
-   If `Left` or `Right` is typed with the `${Shift}` key down, then the
    cursor moves and the selection is extended to include the new
    character.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`Left` and `${Ctrl}`-`Right` move the cursor by words.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Left` and `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Right` move the cursor by
    words and also extend the selection.
-   `Up` and `Down` move the cursor one line up or down and clear any
    selection in the text.
-   If `Up` or `Down` is typed with `${Shift}` down, then the cursor moves
    and the selection is extended to include the new characters.
-   `${PgUp}` and `${PgDn}` move the cursor forward or backwards by one
    screenful and clear any selection in the text.
-   If `${Shift}` is held down while `${PgUp}` or `${PgDn}` is typed, then the
    selection is extended to include the new characters.
-   `Home` moves the cursor to the beginning of its line and clears any
    selection.
-   `${Shift}`-`Home` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line and
    also extends the selection to that point.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`Home` and `${Ctrl}`-`Up` move the cursor to the beginning of
    the text and clear any selection.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Home` and `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Up` move the cursor to the
    beginning of the text and also extend the selection to that point.
-   `End` moves the cursor to the end of the line and clears any
    selection.
-   `${Shift}`-`End` moves the cursor to the end of the line and extends
    the selection to that point.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`End` and `${Ctrl}`-`Down` move the cursor to the end of the
    text and clear any selection.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`End` and `${Ctrl}`-`${Shift}`-`Down` move the cursor to
    the end of the text and extend the selection to that point.

## Modify text

-   If any normal printing characters are typed, they are inserted at
    the point of the cursor.
-   `Del` deletes the selection, if any. Otherwise, it deletes the
    character to the right of the cursor.

    character to the left of the cursor.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`H` deletes the character to the left of the cursor.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`K` deletes from the cursor to the end of its line; if the
    cursor is already at the end of a line, then `${Ctrl}`-`K` deletes the
    newline character.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`D` deletes the character to the right of the cursor.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`T` reverses the order of the two characters to the left and
    right of the cursor.
-   `${Ctrl}`-`O` opens a new line by inserting a newline character in
    front of the cursor without moving the cursor.

    uppercase.

    lowercase.

> formatting (see below) cannot be undone using this mechanism. Also, text
> formats are lost after redo operation.

    the cursor.

    the window.

    text. This is enabled or disabled via the options dialog.
