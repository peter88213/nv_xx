# nv_themes

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_themes](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_themes/) release.

The plugin adds a **Change theme** entry to the *novelibre* **View**
menu.

If you just want a dark mode for *novelibre*, do install the
[nv_dark](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_dark/) plugin instead of
*nv_themes*. Changing the theme is not enough to get a dark mode. You
also need a modified color palette so that the colored text stands out
against the dark background. *nv_dark* comes with such a color palette.

Actually, this plugin is more intended for Linux, where the default
theme looks pretty stale, and there are plenty of desktops, each with a
different look.

On Windows, *novelibre* uses a lot of native widgets by default. You can
hardly do better with custom themes.

## Install additional themes

By default, you can choose from a few themes that are not particularly
attractive. To take full advantage of this plugin, you need the
**ttkthemes** package, which is recommended on the plugin\'s homepage.
If you are familiar with Python, you can install it using *pip*, as
described by the provider. On Linux, it may be more convenient to use
the distribution\'s package manager.

Here is an example with *Synaptic* on Linux Mint:

## Start the dialog

Start the theme changer from the main menu: **View \> Change theme**.
You can select the new theme from a drop-down list.

When you select a theme, the display changes immediately. However, this
is only a non-binding preview. Not all display elements may have their
final color. Better restart *novelibre* after you have changed the
theme.
