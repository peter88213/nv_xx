With **${Chapter} > ${Set Type}**, you can set the

## ${Move selected chapters to new project}

**Split one book in two**

With **${Chapter} > ${Move selected chapters to new project}** you can create
a new project containing the moved chapters/sections and all related
elements and plot lines/plot points. The selected chapters are removed
from the current project and pasted into an auto-generated project whose
file path you define with a file selection dialog. All relationships of
the moved sections are retained.

## ${Export chapter descriptions for editing}

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Chapter} > ${Export chapter descriptions for editing}**, you can
create a text document that contains a **brief synopsis** with
part/chapter headings and chapter descriptions that can be edited and
reimported. File name suffix is `_chapters_tmp`.

## ${Export chapter table}

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Chapter} > ${Export chapter table}**, you can create a spreadsheet
that contains a row per chapter. The document can be edited with *Calc*
and reimported. File name suffix is `_chapterlist_tmp`.

> **Note**
> 
> You can reorder, hide or delete columns and rows without affecting the
> reimport. Only the first column and the first row, which are hidden by
> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.
