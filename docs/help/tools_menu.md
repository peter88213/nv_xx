# ${Tools} menu

**Miscellaneous functions**

> **Note**
> 
> The *${Tools}* menu can be extended by plugins to add more features.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ${Backup options}

**Project independent program settings**

With **${Tools} > ${Backup options}**, you can open a dialog for settings
concerning the backup.

The path to the backup directory is displayed at the top of the window,
if one is set.

### ${Change backup directory}

This opens a directory selection dialog with which you can select the
backup directory.

> **Tip**
> 
> To take precautions against hard disk failure, you can also specify an
> external drive or a USB stick.

### ${Open backup directory}

This opens the backup directory with the file manager. This is for quick
access if you want to restore a project file.

### ${Create backup copies}

If this field is checked, *novelibre* creates a compressed copy of the
project file in the set backup directory each time it is saves.

> **Hint**
> 
> This allows you to temporarily switch off the backup, whereby the backup
> directory remains set.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ${Open installation folder}

**Launch the file manager**

With **${Tools} > ${Open installation folder}**, you can launch the file
manager with the *novelibre* installation folder. This might come in
handy if you wish to edit configuration files, or install your own
plugins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ${Plugin Manager}

**Display and manage installed plugins**

With **${Tools} > ${Plugin Manager}**, you can open the 
*${Installed plugins}* dialog.

![novelibre screenshot](images/tools_menu01.png)

-   Successfully installed plugins are displayed black on white by
    default.
-   Outdated plugins are grayed out.
-   Plugins that cannot run are displayed in red, with an error message.

### How to update a plugin

1.  Select the plugin you want to update. If the **${Home page}**
    button is activated, you can click on it, and your system
    browser opens the plugin home page. Otherwise, you have to know
    the source of the plugin yourself.
2.  Go to the plugin home page and download the latest release.
    Install it according to the instructions.

### How to uninstall a plugin

Select the plugin, and click on the **${Delete}** button.

> **About version compatibility**
> 
> On the window frame, you see the *novelibre* version, consisting of
> three numbers that are separated by points.
> 
> `<major version number>.<minor version number>.<patch level>`
> 
> In the **${novelibre API}** column, you see the plugin's compatibility
> information, consisting of two numbers that are separated by points.
> 
> `<major version number>.<minor version number>`
> 
> ### The rule for compatibility
> 
> -   The plugin's *${novelibre API}* major version number must be the
>     same as *novelibre's* major version number.
> -   The plugin's *${novelibre API}* minor version number must be less
>     than or equal to *novelibre's* minor version number.
> 
> ### Fix incompatibilities
> 
> -   If the plugin's *${novelibre API}* major version number is greater
>     than *novelibre's* major version number, *novelibre* needs to be
>     updated.
> -   If the plugin's *${novelibre API}* major version number is less
>     than *novelibre's* major version number, the plugin needs to be
>     updated.
> -   If the plugin's *${novelibre API}* minor version number is greater
>     than *novelibre's* minor version number, *novelibre* needs to be
>     updated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ${Show notes}

**Show an HTML report with all the "sticky notes"**

With **${Tools} > ${Show notes}**, you can create a HTML file that contains
all "sticky notes" along with the titles of the tree elements they are
associated with, and launch your system's web browser for displaying it.

> **Note**
> 
> The report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit. If needed,
> you can have your web browser save or print it.
