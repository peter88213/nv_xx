# nv_zim

**User guide**

This page refers to the latest
[nv_zim](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_zim/) release. You can open it
with **${Help} > ${Zim connection Online help}**.

*nv_zim* is a plugin that connects *novelibre* projects with a *Zim
Desktop Wiki*. This is mainly intended for world building documentation.

The plugin adds an **${Zim Desktop Wiki}** entry to the *novelibre*
**${Tools}** menu, and a **${Zim connection Online help}** entry to the
**${Help}** menu. The property views of characters, locations, items, and
book get a ![Zim](images/zim.png) button. The Toolbar gets a ![Zim](images/zim.png) button.

## Setting up Zim Desktop Wiki

## General

To launch the [Zim Desktop Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/) application,
*nv_zim* must know the location of its installation. If you have
installed Zim in the default directory, there is nothing to do here.



> **Note**
>
> At program startup, *nv_zim* checks the `launchers.ini` file in the
> *novelibre* configuration directory. Here is an example with a Windows entry:
> 
> ```    
> [SETTINGS]
>     .zim = C:/Program Files (x86)/Zim Desktop Wiki/zim.exe
> ```
> 
> If this file doesn't exist, or the path doesn't fit, the program
> searches the default installation paths for the 32-bit and the 64-bit
> versions under Windows, as well as `/usr/bin/zim` under Linux. If this
> fails, it opens a file selection dialog, asking for the location. The
> proper location is then automatically entered in the `launchers.ini` file.

## Zim notebooks as project wikis

The *nv_zim* plugin extends the *novelibre* user interface, so you can
conveniently launch the *Zim Desktop Wiki* application with a
project-related notebook or a context-related wiki page. Basically, this
works with any Zim notebook, even with pages that belong to different
notebooks. However, it is recommended to create a notebook called
*project wiki* linked with the current *novelibre* project, or with
multiple projects that belong to a series. Then the program can
automatically generate missing pages in this notebook.

### File locations

Project wikis may be located anywhere. However, auto-created ones are
put into a subdirectory of the *novelibre* project, named
`<project name>_zim`.

-   If you later move the project wiki to another location, the next
    time you open it from within *novelibre* you can select it with a
    file selection dialog and link to it again.
-   If you move the project wiki to another location together with the
    *novelibre* project, the program can automatically correct the wiki links.
-   Even if you leave the project wiki where it is, but move the
    *novelibre* project somewhere else, the program can automatically
    correct the wiki links.

### Notebook structure

Auto-generated project wikis have a "flat" structure, which means: all
wiki pages are located in the Zim notebook's *Home* folder. Groupings
and tree structures can be created using links on appropriately
structured overview pages. Compared to a folder structure, this has the
advantage that each page can be categorized under several different
aspects. If you prefer a hierarchical structure instead, you can
subsequently move auto-generated wiki pages with *Zim*, but you may have
to renew the link in *novelibre* via the selection dialog.

### Tags

*novelibre* offers the option of assigning tags to characters,
locations, and items. When *nv_zim* auto-generates a wiki page, it
inserts existing tags in the appropriate notation for *Zim*, allowing
the application to group and link pages according to the categories
represented by the tags.

### Wiki links in novelibre

*novelibre* saves the file paths of the project wiki and the wiki pages
in the *.novx* file, if the project is not locked at the time of
linking. Otherwise, the program only remembers these file paths for the
current session, so as not to change the locked project. However, if you
subsequently unlock the project and reopen the wiki or a page, it will
automatically save the file paths and display a corresponding message on
the status bar.



> **Tip**
> 
> If you want to link more than one wiki page with a character, location,
> item, or the entire book, you can use regular
> [links](../world_view.html#links). When the *nv_zim* is installed,
> *novelibre* will recognize wiki pages among the links and open them with
> the *Zim* application.


## ${Zim Desktop Wiki} menu

### ${Open project wiki}

With **${Tools} > ${Zim Desktop Wiki} > ${Open project wiki}**, or clicking on
the ![Zim](images/zim.png) button on the toolbar, you can open the Zim
notebook linked with the project.

If there is no link yet, or if the saved link address is not valid, you
will be asked whether you want to open an existing wiki or create a new
one:

#### ${Browse}

this opens a file picker dialog to search for a Zim wiki file with
the extension `.zim`. Zim is launched with the selected project wiki
open.



> **Note**
> 
> The selected file will be linked as the project wiki, if the project
> is not locked. If the project is locked, you can open the project
> wiki from within *novelibre* during the current session, but you may
> have to re-select it in the next session.


#### ${Create}

this auto-creates a new blank Zim notebook in a subdirectory of the
project directory, and opens it with Zim.



> **Note**
> 
> The new *.zim* file will be linked as the project wiki, if the
> project is not locked. If the project is locked, you can open the
> project wiki from within *novelibre* during the current session, but
> you may have to re-select it in the next session.

#### ${Cancel}

Aborts the operation without launching Zim.


>  **Hint**
> 
> If you want to open the project wiki or a wiki page from within
> *novelibre*, but don't see any reaction, please take a look at the
> taskbar and see whether the *Zim Desktop Wiki* application is already
> open, but is covered by other open windows, e.g. by *novelibre*. In this
> case, the "Zim" window is not automatically lifted to the foreground.


### ${Create project wiki}

With **${Tools} > ${Zim Desktop Wiki} > ${Create project wiki}** you can create
a new Zim notebook in a subdirectory of the project directory and open
it with Zim. The generated project wiki contains pages for the book and
for all characters, locations, and items. If there is already a Zim
notebook in the target directory, this directory is automatically
renamed and kept as a backup.



> **Note**
> 
> The new *.zim* file will be linked as the project wiki, if the project
> is not locked. If the project is locked, you can open the project wiki
> from within *novelibre* during the current session, but you may have to
> re-select it in the next session.


### ${Remove wiki links}

With **${Tools} > ${Zim Desktop Wiki} > ${Remove wiki links}** you can remove
saved wiki links from the project file. This takes effect when saving
the next time.

A submenu offers two options:

#### ${Selected pages}

This will remove the Zim wiki links of the selected elements. This
command only refers to linked pages, but not to the project wiki.

#### ${All}

This will remove all Zim wiki links. This command refers both to
linked pages and to the project wiki.

## Book/Characters/Locations/Items properties

### ![Zim](images/zim.png) Wiki page button

#### Opening/creating a wiki page

By clicking on the Wiki page button you open a linked wiki page with Zim.

If no wiki page is linked yet, the program first tries to find a page in
the project wiki whose name matches the title of the book, the location
or the item, or the full name of the character, if known, otherwise the
short name. If a matching page is found, the program creates a link and
opens this page after asking.

If no project wiki has been defined yet, the program first asks for the
project wiki and gives you the option of selecting or creating it (see
above). You will then be asked whether you want to open an existing wiki
page or create a new one:

##### ${Browse}

this opens a file picker dialog to search for a Zim page file with
the extension *.txt*. Zim is launched with the selected wiki page
open.


> **Note**
> 
> The selected file will be linked with the element currently selected
> in *novelibre*, if the project is not locked. If the project is
> locked, you can open the wiki page from within *novelibre* during
> the current session, but you may have to re-select it in the next session.


##### ${Create}

this auto-creates a new wiki page as a part of the project wiki, and
opens it with Zim.


> **Note**
> 
> The new *.txt* file will be linked with the element currently
> selected in *novelibre*, if the project is not locked. If the
> project is locked, you can open the wiki page from within
> *novelibre* during the current session, but you may have to
> re-select it in the next session.


##### ${Cancel}

Aborts the operation without launching Zim.

#### Removing a wiki page link

Clicking on the Wiki page button while holding down the `Alt` key
removes the link after confirmation.
