**User guide**

[nv_statistics](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_statistics/) release.
You can open it with **${Help} > ${Project statistics Online help}**.

The plugin adds a **${Project statistics view}** entry to the *novelibre*
**${Tools}** menu, and a **${Project statistics Online help}** entry to the
**${Help}** menu. The Toolbar gets a ![Statistics](images/statistics.png)
button.

## Charts

number of words in all the used sections.

By double-clicking on a label you can select the related element in the
*novelibre* tree view.

## Change the scale
