# ${Items} menu

**Item operation**

## ${Add}

**Add a new item**

With **${Items} > ${Add}**, you can add an item to the tree.

-   If an item is selected, the new item is placed after the selected
    one.
-   Otherwise, the new item is placed at the last position.
-   The new item has an auto-generated title. You can change it in the
    right pane.

## ${Import}

**Import items from another project**

With **${Items} > ${Import}**, you can import a selection of items from
another project. First you select an XML file containing the item data.
Then you select the items you want to add to the current project.

> **Hint**
> 
> To create an XML item data file for the current project, use
> **${Export} > ${XML data files}**.

## ${Export item descriptions for editing}

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Items} > ${Export item descriptions for editing}**, you can create a
text document that contains item descriptions that can be edited with
*Writer* and reimported. File name suffix is `_items_tmp`.

## ${Export item table}

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **${Items} > ${Export item table}**, you can create a spreadsheet that
contains a row per item. The document can be edited with *Calc* and
reimported. File name suffix is `_itemlist_tmp`.

> **Note**
> 
> You can reorder, hide or delete columns and rows without affecting the
> reimport. Only the first column and the first row, which are hidden by
> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.

## ${Show table in Browser}

**Show an HTML report with items data**

With **${Items} > ${Show table in Browser}**, you can create a HTML file that
contains an item table, and launch your system's web browser for
displaying it.

> The report is a temporary file, auto-deleted on program exit. If needed,
> you can have your web browser save or print it.
