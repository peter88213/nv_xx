    level after the selection, if possible.
-   Otherwise, the new part is placed at the last position on the
    chapter level.
-   The new part has an auto-generated title. You can change it in the
    right pane.

## Export part descriptions for editing

**Export an ODT document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Part > Export part descriptions for editing**, you can create a
text document that contains a **very brief synopsis** with part headings
and part descriptions. File name suffix is `_parts_tmp`.

## Export part table

**Export an ODS document that can be imported again after editing**

With **Part > Export part table**, you can create a spreadsheet that
contains a row per part. File name suffix is `_partlist_tmp`.

> default, must not be changed as they contain the structural information
> for the import.
