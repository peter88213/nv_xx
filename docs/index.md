# ![N](img/nLogo32.png) novelibre

[novelibre](https://github.com/peter88213/novelibre/) helps novelists to plan extensive novels and to keep track of them during creation and revision.

*novelibre* is designed for writers who are familiar with LibreOffice or OpenOffice. 

*novelibre* is an add-on to OpenOffice or LibreOffice that helps to break down large novels into parts, chapters and sections, all of which are provided with additional information called metadata.
The metadata remain permanently associated with the chapters and sections in the ODT manuscript throughout the work on the novel. 
*novelibre* makes information about the story world accessible and relates characters, locations, and items to the sections.
*novelibre* can hold information about plot lines and plot points that are assigned to the sections.

This is how the *novelibre* organizer workspace looks like:
