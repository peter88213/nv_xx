# ${Section} properties

The Section properties view opens in the right pane when you select a
section in the tree.

![Screenshot](images/section_view01.png)

## Title and description

Title and description are displayed in an editable "index card".

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the `Enter` key.
Changes to the description are applied when the mouse is clicked
anywhere outside the text input field.

## ${Tags}

Tags are a very freely usable tool for labeling sections in the tree
view. Tags do not have to be defined elsewhere, but simply entered in
the input field separated by semicolons. Editing can be completed by
pressing the `Enter` key.

> **Caution**
> 
> If you want to use a tag more than once, make sure you use the same
> spelling in the different places.

## ${Viewpoint}

The viewpoint character's short name is displayed in the tree view. You
can select it from a drop-down list containing all characters in the
tree view's sort order. If you click on the topmost entry of the list,
this will clear the viewpoint association.

## ${Unused}

With the **${Unused}** checkbox, you can change the section type.

## ${Append to previous section}

When ticked, there will be no section divider inserted above the
selected section in exported documents. The section just starts a new
paragraph.

## ${Plot}

Expand or collapse this frame by clicking on the label.

### ${Plot lines}

Here you can assign the selected section to the plot lines it belongs
to. The assigned plot lines are displayed in a list in the order they
are assigned to the section.

> **Tip**
> 
> A more convenient way to manage and keep track of plot line assignments
> is offered by the 
> [nv_matrix plugin](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_matrix/).
> 
> You can also assign a section to a plot line by entering text in the
> corresponding *Plot line notes* cell of the plot grid.

#### Add plot line assignment

When clicking on ![${Add}](images/add.png), the "Pick mode" is
activated, and the cursor changes to a "plus" shape. By clicking
on a plot line, it will be related with the section.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can exit the "Pick mode" without selecting an element by
> clicking on the highlighted status bar, or by pressing the `Esc`
> key.

#### Remove plot line assignment

When clicking on ![${Remove}](images/remove.png) or pressing the `${Del}`
key, the selected plot line is removed from the list.

#### View the related element

When double-clicking on a plot line, or clicking on
![${Go to}](images/goto.png), the selected plot line is opened and its
properties are displayed.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can go back to the initially selected section with ![Go
> back](images/goBack.png).

#### Plot line notes

You can enter section-related notes for the plot line selected in
the list of related plot lines. These notes appear in the plot
grid where you also can edit them.

### Plot points

The plot points assigned with the selected section are displayed along
with their plot lines.

> Hint
> 
> To change or clear the plot point assignment, go to the plot point's
> properties.

## Scene

Expand or collapse this frame by clicking on the label.

Here is an example of an "action scene":

![Screenshot](images/section_view03.png)

Here is an example of a "reaction scene" or "sequel":

![Screenshot](images/section_view08.png)

There is a popular theory for "selling writers" that suggests novels
are best divided into scenes, alternating between "action scenes" and
"reaction scenes", or "scenes" and "sequels". If you want to
implement something like this to ensure suspense, you can do so here.

If this is not for you, but you would like to use a different method to
set up a dramaturgical scene micro-structure, you can set the section to
**${Other}**, and get three freely named text fields.

Here is an example of a non-standard scene category:

![Screenshot](images/section_view06.png)

On the other hand, not every section is a scene to which the categories
mentioned above apply. Sections can be characterized by mode of
discourse (e.g. Narration, Dramatic action, Dialogue, Description,
Exposition). So if a section is not staged, you can set the section to
**${Not a scene}**, and get three freely named text fields.

Here is an example of a non-staged section category:

## ${Relationships}

Expand or collapse this frame by clicking on the label.

![Screenshot](images/section_view02.png)

If you want to associate characters, locations, and items with the
section, you can do it here by adding the element to a list of
relationships.

### ${Show ages}

If a section is dated, you can call up the ages of the related
characters who have birth dates.

### Add Relationship

When clicking on ![${Add}](images/add.png), the "Pick mode" is
activated, and the cursor changes to a "plus" shape. By clicking
on a character/location/item, this element will be related with the
section.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can exit the "Pick mode" without selecting an element by
> clicking on the highlighted status bar, or by pressing the `Esc`
> key.

### Remove Relationship

When clicking on ![${Remove}](images/remove.png) or pressing the `${Del}`
key, the selected relationship is removed from the list.

### View the related element

When double-clicking on a related element, or clicking on
![${Go to}](images/goto.png), the selected element is opened and its
properties are displayed.

> **Hint**
> 
> You can go back to the initially selected section with 
> ![Go back](images/goBack.png).

> **Hint**
> 
> A convenient way to manage and keep track of relationships is offered by
> the [nv_matrix plugin](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_matrix/).

## ${Date/Time}

Here you can enter information about the selected section's story time.
Editing can be completed by pressing the `Enter` key.

> **Hint**
> 
> Dedicated timeline software offers a more convenient way of entering
> date/time and duration information. So if chronology is important to
> your story, you might want to take a look at the 
> [Timeline plugin](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_timeline/), or the 
> [Aeon Timeline 2 plugin](https://github.com/peter88213/nv_aeon2/).

### ${Start}

If the selected section is a scene, this is when it starts:

#### ${Date}

Format: *YYYY-MM-DD*, according to ISO 8601.

#### ${Time}

Format: *hh:mm*, according to ISO 8601.

#### ${Day}

Format: Any number. Day "0" is the 
reference date, if set.

> **Note**
> 
> All entries are optional. You can either enter a date, or a day.

#### ${Moon phase}

If the required date information is set, you can call up the
corresponding moon phase.

![Screenshot](images/section_view09.png)

The moon phase information consists of:

-   the phase day (0 to 29, where 0=new moon, 15=full etc.),
-   the visible shape,
-   the fraction illuminated.

> **Note**
> 
> The moon phase calculation is based on a 'do it in your head'
> algorithm by John Conway. In its current form, it's only valid for
> the 20th and 21st centuries.

#### ${Clear date/time}

This will reset *${Date}*, *${Time}*, and *${Day}* simultaneously.

#### ${Generate

This generates date and time from the date/time/duration data of the
previous section, so the selected section follows directly the previous one.

#### ${Convert date/day}

If the reference date is set, The unspecific *${Day}* can be transformed 
into a specific *${Date}*, and vice versa.

> **Hint**
> 
> If necessary, you can convert all sections at once in the 
> ${Book} properties view).

### ${Duration}

#### ${Days}

Any number should be accepted.

#### ${Hours}

If a number greater than 24 is entered, the number of days will be
automatically increased.

#### ${Minutes}

If a number greater than 60 is entered, the number of hours will be
automatically increased.

#### ${Clear duration}

This will reset *${Days}*, *${Hours}*, and *${Minutes}* simultaneously.

#### ${Generate}

This generates the duration from the date/time data of the next
section, so the next section follows directly the current one.

## ${Links}

Expand or collapse this frame by clicking on the label.

![Screenshot](images/world_view02.png)

This is a list for image and research document links.

Although *novelibre* holds some character/location/item data, it is not
the right application for extensive world building. For this, you may
want to use more powerful software, like [Zim Desktop
Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/). In this case, *novelibre* allows you to
create links to the text files that will take you quickly to the right
places in the wiki.

Or you have collected some images that could inspire you when writing.
Then simply create links to these images to open them with your
system's standard image viewer.

> **Tip**
> 
> If you have collected several images for a character in a folder that
> your standard image viewer can browse through, a single link to any
> image file is sufficient.

The links are displayed in a list in the order they are entered.

### ${Add} Link

When clicking on ![${Add}](images/add.png), a file selection dialog
opens. The selected file will be added to the link list.

> **Hint**
>
> By default, the dialog shows image files. For other file types,
> change the selector in the lower right corner.
>
> ![Screenshot](images/filePicker01.png)

### ${Remove} Link

When clicking on ![${Remove}](images/remove.png) or pressing the `${Del}`
key, the selected link is removed from the list.

### ${Open} Link

When double-clicking on a link, or clicking on
![${Go to}](images/goto.png), the link is opened with the standard
application for the link's file type.

> **Hint**
>
> If you want to open certain linked files with another application
> than the standard application, you can provide a *novelibre*
> "launcher" setting. For this, just create a text file named
> **launchers.ini** in the `.novx/config` directory (where all
> configuration files are stored). Here you can assign applications to
> the file extensions.
>
> Zim Desktop wiki pages are a special case. For this, the Zim program
> is assigned to the *.zim* extension.
>
> This example shows a setting that makes *novelibre* open text files
> with the *Zim Desktop Wiki* application instead of the standard text
> editor:
> 
> ```ini
> [SETTINGS]
> .zim = C:/Program Files (x86)/Zim Desktop Wiki/zim.exe 
> ```

## "Sticky note"

The yellow text area is for notes. Changes are applied when the mouse is
clicked anywhere outside the text input field.

When the "sticky note" of a plot point contains text, "${N}" is
displayed in the tree view as a reminder. If the branch of a plot line
with plot points containing notes is collapsed, the "${N}" is displayed
in the plot line row.

## Navigation buttons

-   **${Previous}** lets you navigate to the previous section in the
    tree.
-   **${Next}** lets you navigate to the next section in the tree.
