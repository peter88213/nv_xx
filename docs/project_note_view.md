# ${Project note} properties

The ${Project note} properties view opens in the right pane when you select
a project note in the tree.

## Title and content

Title and content are displayed in an editable "index card".

The editing of the title can be completed by pressing the `Enter` key.
Changes to the content are applied when the mouse is clicked anywhere
outside the text input field.

## ${Links}

Expand or collapse this frame by clicking on the label.

This is a list for image and research document links.

Although *novelibre* holds some character/location/item data, it is not
the right application for extensive world building. For this, you may
want to use more powerful software, like [Zim Desktop
Wiki](https://zim-wiki.org/). In this case, *novelibre* allows you to
create links to the text files that will take you quickly to the right
places in the wiki.

Or you have collected some images that could inspire you when writing.
Then simply create links to these images to open them with your
system's standard image viewer.

> **Tip**
> 
> If you have collected several images for a character in a folder that
> your standard image viewer can browse through, a single link to any
> image file is sufficient.

The links are displayed in a list in the order they are entered.

### ${Add} Link

When clicking on ![${Add}](images/add.png), a file selection dialog
opens. The selected file will be added to the link list.

> **Hint**
>
> By default, the dialog shows image files. For other file types,
> change the selector in the lower right corner.

### ${Remove} Link

When clicking on ![${Remove}](images/remove.png) or pressing the `Del`
key, the selected link is removed from the list.

### ${Open} Link

When double-clicking on a link, or clicking on
![${Go to}](images/goto.png), the link is opened with the standard
application for the link's file type.

> **Hint**
>
> If you want to open certain linked files with another application
> than the standard application, you can provide a *novelibre*
> "launcher" setting. For this, just create a text file named
> **launchers.ini** in the `.novx/config` directory (where all
> configuration files are stored). Here you can assign applications to
> the file extensions.
>
> Zim Desktop wiki pages are a special case. For this, the Zim program
> is assigned to the *.zim* extension.
>
> This example shows a setting that makes *novelibre* open text files
> with the *Zim Desktop Wiki* application instead of the standard text
> editor:
> 
> ```ini
> [SETTINGS]
> .zim = C:/Program Files (x86)/Zim Desktop Wiki/zim.exe 
> ```
